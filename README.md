Crispy System is a modular PHP CMS-Framework which is a Work In Progress.

## Modules
Modules should be cloned into the `/modules` directory.

## Overriding resources
Modules can have default templates and styling, these are in `/modules/MODULENAME/resources/SIDE/`, to override these, create the following structure: `/resources/modules/MODULENAME/SIDE/`.

## Todo
